# HyperSpectralImageClassification
This project focuses on the analysis of hyperspectral imagery from the Pavia University dataset. The primary objectives include:
•	Estimating abundance maps using various unmixing techniques.
•	Classifying the hyperspectral data using multiple machine learning classifiers.
•	Evaluating the performance of these classifiers through cross-validation and confusion matrices
